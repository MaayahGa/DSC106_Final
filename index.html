    <h3>What have we done so far?</h3>
    <p>
      We found a group of datasets on kaggle containing information on tens of thousands of Clash Royale battles for this project.
      We have done some data cleaning with these datasets, including concating datasets from different dates, merging dataset of battles
      and cards, dropping irrelavent columns. We then developed this simple webpage template, where the journey section is intended
      to show the stats of battles in different arenas and the bar chart is to show the use rate of cards. We also have implemented
      a interaction so that users can filter the cards usage data in the bar chart by clicking on arenas.
    </p>
    <h3>What will be the most challenging of our project to design and why?</h3>
    <p>
      The most challenging is the size of the datasets we use. We have ten datasets, each contains information of around 3,000,000 battles during
      one certain day, and the entire package is over 22 GB. Running codes to concate datasets of this size will cause memory errors.
      To fix this issue, we decide to randomly select 1/10 of the rows from each dataset so the overall size is reduced.
