              <p>
                In the Season 18 ladder, as players climb from mid to high
                arenas, the cards that win most often aren’t the “toxic” troop
                cards players complain about. Instead, quiet support cards like
                cheap spells show up in a huge share of winning decks.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ll walk through a short story, one arena at a time, and then
                let you explore the full dataset yourself.

                If you scroll through Reddit, Twitter or YouTube, people point
                fingers at familiar “toxic” cards — things like Little Prince,
                Firecracker or Royal Recruits — and blame them for unfair
                games.

                In lower arenas like Spooky Town, the cards people complain
                about <strong>do</strong> line up with what wins. Many of the

                The chart on the right compares “toxic troops” to “cheap
                spells” by total wins for this arena only.

                often in winning decks.
              </p>

                Watch how the mean line for cheap spells starts to creep up

                Between Serenity Peak and Legendary Arena, Miner's Mine is where
                support cards really start to pull away. Quiet spells like The Log
                and Zap show up in more and more winning decks, while some early
                “toxic” troops fall off.

                By the time we reach Legendary Arena, the story flips. Quiet
                support cards and cheap spells show up in a huge share of
                winning decks, and their average wins can beat out many “toxic”
                troops.

              <p>
                This is the main evidence for our proposition: at higher arenas,
                <strong>support cards matter more than the loud complaints
                suggest</strong>.

              <p>
                Across arenas, toxic troops are visible and memorable — they
                create the moments people complain about. But in higher arenas,
                the cards that quietly drive wins are often cheap spells and
                support cards that show up again and again in successful decks.
